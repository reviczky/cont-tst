Thus, I came to the conclusion that the designer of a new system
must not only be the implementer and first large--scale
user;\someline [here] the designer should also write the first
user manual.

The separation of any of these four components would have hurt
\TeX\ significantly. If I had not participated fully in all these
activities, literally hundreds of improvements would never have
\someline[there]been made, because I would never have thought of
them or perceived why they were important.

But a system \startline[range]cannot be successful if it is too
strongly influenced by a single person. Once the initial design is
complete and fairly robust, the real test begins as people with
many different \stopline[range] viewpoints undertake their own
experiments. (DEK)
