% We do (officially) support multiple features sets and (inofficially, as messy) a direct
% assignment as it's much cleaner to define a proper feature (as it is also much more
% efficient) but for a quick hack it's ok.
%
% Because it does not work out well with an overload this trickery is currently disabled
% but we keep the test.
